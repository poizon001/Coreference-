Concepcion, 23 Aug 88 (Santiago Domestic Service) -- [Report]
[Miguel Angel Valdebenito] [Text] Police sources have reported that
unidentified individuals planted a bomb in front of a Mormon Church in
Talcahuano District. The bomb, which exploded and caused property
damage worth 50,000 pesos, was placed at a chapel of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints located at No 3856 Gomez Carreno
Street.

   The shock wave destroyed a wall, the roof, and the windows of the
church, but did not cause any injuries.

   Carabineros bomb squad personnel immediately went to the location
and discovered that the bomb was made of 50 grams of an-fo [ammonium
nitrate-fuel oil blasting agents] and a slow fuse.

   Carabineros special forces soon raided a large area to try to
arrest those responsible for the attack, but they were unsuccessful.

   The police have already informed the appropriate authorities, that
is, the national prosecutor and the Talcahuano criminal court, of this
attack.
